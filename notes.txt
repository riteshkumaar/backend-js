* terminal - npm init -> npm initialises the repository
* a json file is now formed 


* make a readme.md file 

* git init -> git respository is now initialised and you are now tracking all files
* git add . -> adds all the files to repository
* git commit -m "add initial files for backend"
* right now we are in the master branch 
* Now got to github and create a new repository
* now come back to terminal here and do ' git branch -M main' 
* the above command changes the current branch to main -> this is done to match github standards
* git remote add origin -> which tells the repository where to actually push the files
* git push -u origin main -> this is the final step

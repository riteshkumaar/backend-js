* terminal - npm init -> npm initialises the repository
* a json file is now formed 


* make a readme.md file 

* git init -> git respository is now initialised and you are now tracking all files
* git add . -> adds all the files to repository
* git commit -m "add initial files for backend"
* right now we are in the master branch 
* Now got to github and create a new repository
* now come back to terminal here and do ' git branch -M main' 
* the above command changes the current branch to main -> this is done to match github standards
* git remote add origin -> which tells the repository where to actually push the files
* git push -u origin main -> this is the final step

** in case of any errors, git remote remove origin and then set remote again and then push it 

*now make a public folder and add a temp folder 
* git status -> it only tracks folders so nothing is visible for now 
* now make a .gitkeep file inside the temp folder 
-> now I can track these folders as well

* now move out of public and make a git ignore file then head to gitignore on chrome -> git ignore.io 
then type node and copy paste that full content in the .gitignore files which will not be pushed
* the env variables are picked from the system to keep them secure so make a .env file now
* make another folder src in root
* touch idx.js -> makes a file in your correct directory as idx.js
* in package.json set type to module

** now we will use a utility called nodemon which restarts the server everytime we make any changes
*dev dependencies -> used only during development and not in production
* npm i -D nodemon
* go to package.json in scripts, add /*   "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"   */
* git status
* git add .
* git commit -m "setup project files"
* git push 
* in src>mkdir controller dB middlewares(to check for anything)
